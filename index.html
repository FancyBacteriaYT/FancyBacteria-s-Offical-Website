<h2>General Information</h2>
<h3>Channel History ( W.I.P. )</h3>

  <h3>Channel Formation</h3>
  It all started on March 4, 2022 when the channel was first created, and was registered under the name "Polandtacomappertacos", in reference to my Scratch account at the time. There were no initial ambitions to become what I am today, 
  the account was merely created to subscribe to other channels that I liked. However, just less than a month after the fateful day, on April 1st of 2022, I have uploaded my first video, being titled "Lava", the video lasted only 47 seconds, 
  with me at the time walking up to Carl from the beloved Roblox game titled "NPCs are becoming smart!". I went up to Carl and told him "The floor is lava" with lava rising up from the grass, we both got on top of the roof, 
  then with sheer bored-ness, I jumped into the lava, earning an ending. now, I only uploaded that video as an experiment, to see how viral it would go. Then one experiment turns into two experiments, then three, and now I am here.

<h3>Beginning Stages of the channel</h3>
<p>After I pursued YouTube as a hobby, I initially started with producing Tower Defense Simulator and SCP Roleplay content, producing challenges, unusual media, and sometimes animations about the two topics.
  I would also have produced shitpost content along the way, usually in the forms of meme galleries or out of context clips. But I would slowly move towards SCP: Anomaly Breach by making gameplay videos and memes about the topic.
  One highlight of the SCP AB content was " SCP: Anomaly Breach 2 Slander (Again) " which was essentially me disguising my madness for the missing Nu-7 update as a regular video poking fun at the game.
