<h4 class="box2">Channel Formation</h4>
<p class="box3">
  It all started on March 4, 2022 when the channel was first created, and was registered under the name "Polandtacomappertacos", in reference to my Scratch account at the time. There were no initial ambitions to become what I am today, 
  the account was merely created to subscribe to other channels that I liked. However, just less than a month after the fateful day, on April 1st of 2022, I have uploaded my first video, being titled "Lava", the video lasted only 47 seconds, 
  with me at the time walking up to Carl from the beloved Roblox game titled "NPCs are becoming smart!". I went up to Carl and told him "The floor is lava" with lava rising up from the grass, we both got on top of the roof, 
  then with sheer bored-ness, I jumped into the lava, earning an ending. now, I only uploaded that video as an experiment, to see how viral it would go. Then one experiment turns into two experiments, then three, and now I am here.

<em class="box2">"Everytime I watch that video, I can't stop but think that this is only just an innocent, past version of myself. Combined with the music and the fact that 
  he doesn't know all the pain that he is going to go through nor the fact that this is were my career starts, I just can't stop myself from shedding a tear." <br> - Me 2025
